# css-zen-garden

part of our studies in 2021 was implementing a version of the classic [CSS Zen Garden](https://www.csszengarden.com/).
i was going for a kinda spacey look and ended up with [something](https://johannesrave.github.io/css-zen-garden/) quite colorful and typo-oriented. i really enjoyed the assignment and it has informed my perspective on CSS to this day.
